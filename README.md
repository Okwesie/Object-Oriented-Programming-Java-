## Introduction
This repository is a collection of projects demonstrating my understanding and application of core object-oriented programming principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These projects cover a range of real-world scenarios, implemented using OOP best practices.

## Projects

### 1. **Income Tax Calculator**
   - A program that can compute the income tax and net salary given some gross monthly salary entered by the user.

### 2. **Guessing Game**
   - A program that picks a number at random and does not disclose the number to the user, but allows the user to try to guess the chosen number

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java and Python
- **Tools**: IntelliJ, Thonny

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-oriented-programming.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd object-oriented-programming
```

Run the projects individually by following the instructions in each sub-directory's `README.md` file.

## Contributing
